    "A linear relationship between two variables is one in which the scatterplot of them looks roughly like a line.  *Linear regression* is a method for modelling how a *dependent variable* linearly depends on one or more *independent variables*.  The dependent variable (also called a *response variable* and many other things) is what we are trying to model or predict, and is usually denoted $Y$.  The independent variables (also called *explanatory variables*, *input variables*, or *predictors*) are the information we are using to make the prediction, and are usually denoted $X_1, X_2, ...$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear relationship is: $$Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + ... + \\beta_n X_n + \\epsilon$$\n",
